# DeFi Kingdom Clone on Avalanche

### Description
Welcome to the DeFi Kingdom Clone on Avalanche! This project aims to create a blockchain-based gaming experience where players can collect, build, and battle with digital assets while earning rewards through various game activities. By utilizing the EVM Subnet on Avalanche, you can deploy custom smart contracts to a low-fee custom chain with your own native token, allowing you to architect and customize your game according to your vision.

Please note that this readme file will focus on the custom subnet development aspects of DeFi Kingdoms and provide an overview of the steps involved in building your own DeFi empire.

### Challenge: Building Your DeFi Empire
In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up your own EVM subnet on Avalanche, which serves as a starting point for building your DeFi Kingdom clone. You will be guided through the process of creating and deploying a custom subnet, along with two foundational smart contracts: an ERC20 token contract and a Vault contract. These contracts will lay the groundwork for your DeFi Kingdom clone and enable you to explore the world of decentralized finance while taking your first steps towards building your empire.

Please note that this tutorial will not cover the intricacies of how DeFi works or how to generate value for users. The focus here is on setting up an EVM subnet on Avalanche and deploying foundational smart contracts for your DeFi Kingdom clone. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of DeFi and its various concepts, we recommend referring to the official documentation.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To successfully set up and deploy your DeFi Kingdom Clone on Avalanche, ensure you have the following:

Unix Computer (MacOS or Linux)
Solidity
Remix
Metamask
Web Browser
### Installation
Download the necessary programs and tools to your Unix computer.
Set up Metamask and connect it to your EVM Subnet on Avalanche using the steps provided in our guide.
### Deployment
Follow these steps to deploy your DeFi Kingdom Clone on Avalanche:

Set up your EVM subnet: Refer to our guide and the Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network.
Define your native currency: Set up your own native currency, which will serve as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone.
Connect to Metamask: Connect your EVM Subnet to Metamask by following the steps outlined in our guide.
Deploy basic building blocks: Use Solidity and Remix to deploy the basic building blocks of your game, such as smart contracts for battling, exploring, and trading. These contracts will define the game rules, liquidity pools, tokens, and more.
To deploy the ERC20 contract, use the following code:

### solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract ERC20 {
    // Contract variables and functions
}
To deploy the Vault contract, use the following code:

### solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

interface IERC20 {
    // Interface functions
}

contract Vault {
    // Contract variables and functions
}
### Testing
After deploying your smart contracts, you can test your application using Remix. Use Remix to interact with your deployed smart contracts, deploy tokens, create liquidity pools, and more.
